# Mac Window-To-GIF Recorder

I have been using LICECap program for desktop GIF recordording for a while now. Unfortunately, in LICECap you have to adjust recording frame for every window separately and sometimes it does not work so well. I decided to make use of Apple Quartz Window Services API and imporve the concept a little bit. Now you can select the specific window you want to record and adjust the image/scale quality and FPS. 
You can download the app from my [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/s/4olykfd4qbtcs8r/Wind.app.zip?dl=0) or build it in Xcode.
