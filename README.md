# Window-To-Gif Recorder

I have been using LICECap program for desktop GIF recordording for a while now. Unfortunately, in LICECap you have to adjust recording for every window separately and sometimes it does not work so well. I decided to make use of Apple Quartz Window Services API and imporve the concept a little bit. Now you can select the specific window you want to record and adjust the image/scale quality and FPS.
